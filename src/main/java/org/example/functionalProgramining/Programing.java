    //what is functioonal programing
    //functional programing is a style of programing where the main logic is written in the form of functions

    ///impertive declaritive
    //imperative programing is a style of programing where the main logic is written in the form of statements
    //declaritive programing is a style of programing where the main logic is written in the form of expressions

    //Declarative programming focuses on what things are, whereas imperative programming focuses on how to compute a given result.

    //functional purity - a function is said to be pure if it always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects
    //side effects - a function is said to have side effects if it modifies the state of the program or the outside world
